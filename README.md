## ScareBnb Description

Welcome to the spookiest of bed and breakfasts!

ScareBnB is a place for ghouls to rent the perfect haunted house for thier vacation. They're given the choice between two victorian manors; one an imposing mansion on the edge of a graveyard and the other a perfectly dilapidated witches lare in an enchanted forest. While visiting, ghouls can roam the beautiful graveyards, or commune with the local ghosts. These haunted manors also come fulling stocked with everything needed to fulfill your every spooky need! Happy seance, and enter if you dare üéÉ‚ò†Ô∏èüéÉ

## Typography 

I chose the following font families for my spooky site: 

* **Cinzel**: for all h1s.
* **IM Fell Double Pica**: for all all other headers.
* **Baskerville**: for the body.

**Cinzel** and **IM Fell** are both really great spooky fonts, both perfect for renting haunted houses to you friendly neighborhood ghouls. **Cinzel**, in particular, comes with a "black" version, which is an ultra bold version (*font-weight: 900*), that makes great, eye-catching, spooky statement. **IM Fell** has the perfect old-world English look for the rest of the headers, and would not overwhelm the pages the way something as ornate as **Cinzel** would.

While **Baskerville** is not a traditionally spooky font, I wanted something with a classic serif look that was a little more rounded and polished that something like **Times New Roman**. Baskerville has a professional, modern-but-not style that perfectly fit alongside the more draumatic header fonts.

## Feature Integration 

After completing my MVP, I decided to integrate a flip feature to add functionality to my homepage. As it was, I had several sections that went nowhere and creating flipcards allowed me to convey information without added extra (and unnecessary) pages. 

## Next Steps

Going forward, I'd like to add a couple more divs to the main page. In my mockups, I had six different divs, in three sections on the homepage. While creating my site's, I decided to simplify in order to create the best looking product in the amount of time I was given. 

I would also like to be able to manage the input values across all pages so that the amount of ghouls visiting and the checkin/out dates sync across all forms, but can also be edited.
